This is an unofficial log of notable events or thought during the lifetime of this project.
-Getting Apache POI to work in intelliJ is hard. It seems easier to convert the excel documents into .csv
    then create a custom parser to read and input the information. My current plan is to read in zipcodes first,
    then use the zipcode identifier in latsAndLongs to add the corresponding latitudes and longitudes. The big issue
    here seems to be that i'll have to create a database out of the first information, then search and change database
    items based on the second document. Fortunately, both will have been sorted.
-Reading in data properly, but I think one of the reading mechanisms is stuck in an endless loop. The next order of
    business is to add some counter or method of verifying if it's stuck or just taking too damn long.
-In the future I think I would like to make the database store items in a Trie data structure to make it more efficient
    for searching and inserting. It's kinda a lot of work though.
